    Because most students find the instructor *intimidating*[^1], he has
    resorted to all sorts of crazy tricks in an attempt at being more
    *inclusive* and making his office a more *welcoming* place.  For instance,
    to make sure **CSE majors** feel at home, he keeps the lights off in his
    office [^2] and plays soft folk or indie music [^3].  Moreover, he often
    has candy stocked in the **R2D2** and **BB8** containers on his desk [^4].

    Unfortunately, a problem has arisen: too many **students** are now showing up
    to his office and eating the candy.  Because he wants to reward his
    **favorites**[^5], he has decided to give each student a **rating**[^6] and
    distributes **candies** to each student based on this number.

    As a big believer in the important of **Data Structures**, he has visiting
    students line up in a **queue** and distributes the candy to the students such
    that the following constraints are met:

    1. Every **student** gets at least **one candy**.

    2. Every **student** whose **rating** is greater than their neighbors in
    the **queue** should receive more **candy**.

    For example, suppose the following students were in the office hours **queue**:

        Zephan, Mike, Emory

    The instructor may rate the students as:

        1, 0, 2

    To meet the **constraints** above, this means he must at least give Zephan
    `2` candies, Mike `1` candies, and Emory `2` candies, for a total of `5`
    candies.

    After devising this candy distribution scheme, the instructor has become
    distracted with [Clash Royale] and asks you to write the code to determine
    what is the **minimum number of candies** he needs to distribute given a **queue**
    of **students** and their **corresponding ratings**.

    [^1]: Very weird.
    [^2]: Day star bad.

    [^4]: Thank you based `lychee`.
    [^5]: Despite what `bobbit` says, I don't have favorites.
    [^6]: I would never.  Probably.  Maybe.

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of test inputs where each line consists of a
    **queue** of `n` **students** (where `1 <= n <= 1000`) and their
    corresponding **ratings** (where `1 <= rating <= 20`).

    You should read and process each line of input until the *end of the file*.

    ### Example Input

        :::text
        1 0 2
        1 2 2
        1 3 2 2 1

    ## Output

    For each **queue** of **students** and their **ratings**, output the
    **minimum** number of **candies** you need to distribute to the
    **students** to ensure that you meant the constraints above in the following format:

        :::text
        {Student Queue #}. You need {Minimum # of candies} candies.

    ### Example Output

        :::text
        1. You need 5 candies.
        2. You need 4 candies.
        3. You need 7 candies.

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="table table-striped table-bordered" style="background-color: white" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr markdown="1">
      <td width="125px" markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)` where `N` is the number of **ratings**.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(N)` where `N` is the number of **ratings**.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.
