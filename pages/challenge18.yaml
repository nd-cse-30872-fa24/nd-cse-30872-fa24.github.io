    Deckard is special.  Not only did take **Systems Programming** for fun[^1]
    as an **ACMS** major, he also likes to install esoteric operating systems
    on his **Librem 13**[^2].  Tired of running mainstream [Linux] operating
    systems and actually having his hardware work, he has decided to try out a
    [BSD], one of the original free and open source **Unix** operating systems.

    Things were going well... until he tried to build software not supported
    by the primitive package manager on his [BSD] system.  In particular,
    Deckard wants to install `jailbreak`, which is a [rootkit] that escapes the
    hallowed [jails] on [FreeBSD].

    Unfortunately, the program has a number of dependencies that must be
    compiled and installed before he can even build `jailbreak`.  For example,
    given the following `MANIFEST.json`:

        :::json
        {
          "jailbreak": ["smuggler"],
          "chroot": ["smuggler","laughing","marooning"],
          "leftpad": ["smuggler"],
          "sudo": ["marooning","ethological","laughing"],
          "figlet": ["ethological"],
          "cmatrix": ["laughing","marooning"],
          "cowsay": ["smuggler"],
          "smuggler": ["laughing","ethological","marooning"],
          "laughing": ["ethological","marooning"],
          "marooning": ["encountering"],
          "ethological": [],
          "encountering": []
        }

    After parsing this input and generating the dependency graph on the right,
    it is clear that `jailbreak` requires `5` packages (ie. smuggler, laughing,
    ethological, marooning, and encountering) to be built beforehand.

    Moreover, looking at the graph it is also clear that package manager can
    build at most `2` packages concurrently (remember that packages can only be
    built if all their dependencies have been met).

    Determining the number of dependencies for the `jailbreak` package and the
    maximum concurrency for building the packages is a daunting task for an
    **ACMS** major.  He asks that the "big-brained" **CSE** majors help him out
    by parsing a set of package dependencies and outputting the number of
    dependencies and the maximum concurrency.

    ## Input

    You will be given a series of package manifests in the following format:

        :::
        N # Number of packages
        Package Dependencies
        Package Dependencies
        ...

    That is, you are first given the number of packages (`N`)` followed by the
    name of the `package` and a list of its `dependencies` (separated by
    white-space).

    ### Example Input

    Here is an example of the input based on the `MANIFEST.json` above:

        :::text
        12
        jailbreak smuggler
        chroot smuggler laughing marooning
        leftpad smuggler
        sudo marooning ethological laughing
        figlet ethological
        cmatrix laughing marooning
        cowsay smuggler
        smuggler laughing ethological marooning
        laughing ethological marooning
        marooning encountering
        ethological
        encountering


    ## Output

    For each package manifest, you are to output two things:

    1. The number of dependencies required to be built for the `jailbreak`
    program.  2. The maximum concurrency the build system can exploit in
    building the dependencies.

    ### Example Output

    Here is an example output for the package list above:

        :::text
        Number of Dependencies: 5
        Maximum Concurrency: 2

    For each input test case, your solution should have the following targets:

    <table class="table table-striped table-bordered" style="background-color: white" markdown="1">
    <tbody markdown="1">
    <tr markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Time Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(V+E)`, where `V` is the number of packages and `E` is the number of dependencies in **DAG**.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr markdown="1">
      <td markdown="1">**Space Complexity**</td>
      <td markdown="1">`O(V)`, where `V` is the number of packages.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Your solution may be below the targets, but it **should not exceed them**.

    ## Submission

    To submit your work, follow the same procedure you used for [Reading 01]:

        :::bash
        $ cd path/to/cse-30872-fa22-assignments     # Go to assignments repository
        $ git checkout master                       # Make sure we are on master
        $ git pull --rebase                         # Pull any changes from GitHub

        $ git checkout -b challenge18               # Create and checkout challenge18 branch

        $ $EDITOR challenge18/program.cpp           # Edit your code

        $ git add challenge18/program.cpp           # Stage your changes
